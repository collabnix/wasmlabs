Getting Started:

1. Install Rust and 

```
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

```
This will download and install the official compiler for the Rust
programming language, and its package manager, Cargo.

Rustup metadata and toolchains will be installed into the Rustup
home directory, located at:

  /Users/ajeetsraina/.rustup

This can be modified with the RUSTUP_HOME environment variable.

The Cargo home directory is located at:

  /Users/ajeetsraina/.cargo

This can be modified with the CARGO_HOME environment variable.

The cargo, rustc, rustup and other commands will be added to
Cargo's bin directory, located at:

  /Users/ajeetsraina/.cargo/bin

This path will then be added to your PATH environment variable by
modifying the profile files located at:

  /Users/ajeetsraina/.profile
  /Users/ajeetsraina/.zshenv

You can uninstall at any time with rustup self uninstall and
these changes will be reverted.

Current installation options:


   default host triple: aarch64-apple-darwin
     default toolchain: stable (default)
               profile: default
  modify PATH variable: yes

1) Proceed with installation (default)
2) Customize installation
3) Cancel installation
>
```

```
stable-aarch64-apple-darwin installed - rustc 1.69.0 (84c898d65 2023-04-16)


Rust is installed now. Great!

To get started you may need to restart your current shell.
This would reload your PATH environment variable to include
Cargo's bin directory ($HOME/.cargo/bin).

To configure your current shell, run:
source "$HOME/.cargo/env"
```


```
rustup target add wasm32-wasi
info: downloading component 'rust-std' for 'wasm32-wasi'
info: installing component 'rust-std' for 'wasm32-wasi'
 18.9 MiB /  18.9 MiB (100 %)  18.9 MiB/s in  1s ETA:  0s
```

This command will download and install the necessary components for the wasm32-wasi target.Wait for the installation to complete. rustup will fetch the required files and configure your Rust toolchain to support compiling to the wasm32-wasi target.

Once the installation is finished, you can use the wasm32-wasi target when building your Rust code for the WebAssembly System Interface (WASI) environment. This target is specifically designed for running WebAssembly modules outside of a web browser, providing a set of standard APIs for interacting with the host system.

For example, you can compile your Rust code to WebAssembly using the wasm32-wasi target with the following command:

```
cargo build --target wasm32-wasi
```

This command will compile your Rust code to a WebAssembly module (your_wasm_app.wasm) that can be executed in a WASI-compliant runtime environment.

Make sure you have Rust and rustup installed on your system before attempting to add the wasm32-wasi target. You can install Rust and rustup by following the official Rust installation instructions available at: https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install

If you encounter any issues during the installation or have further questions, feel free to ask for assistance.


Building a simple Rust WebAssembly application using the wasm-bindgen crate and interact with it from JavaScript:


```
 cargo new wasm-example
     Created binary (application) `wasm-example` package
```

Open the Cargo.toml file in a text editor and add the following dependencies:

```
[dependencies]
wasm-bindgen = "0.2"
```


```
cargo install wasm-bindgen-cli
```

Create a new Rust source file, src/lib.rs, and replace its contents with the following code:

```
use wasm_bindgen::prelude::*;

#[wasm_bindgen]
pub fn greet(name: &str) -> String {
    format!("Hello, {}!", name)
}
```

This code defines a function greet that takes a string argument and returns a formatted greeting message.

## Build the Rust code into a Wasm binary:

```
cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

This command compiles the Rust code to WebAssembly using the wasm32-unknown-unknown target.

## Generate the JavaScript bindings for the Wasm module:

```
wasm-bindgen target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/debug/wasm-example.wasm --out-dir .
```

The wasm-bindgen command generates JavaScript code that allows you to interact with the Wasm module from JavaScript.

## Create an HTML file, index.html, in the project directory, and add the following code:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>Rust Wasm Example</title>
    <script src="wasm_example.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
    <script>
        const { greet } = wasm_bindgen;
        async function run() {
            await wasm_bindgen('./wasm_example_bg.wasm');
            const greeting = greet('WebAssembly');
            console.log(greeting);
        }
        run();
    </script>
</body>
</html>
```

This HTML file loads the generated JavaScript bindings and calls the greet function, passing the name "WebAssembly". The greeting is logged to the console.

Start a local web server in the project directory. For example, you can use the http-server package:

```
npx http-server .
```

This command starts a local web server serving the files in the current directory.

Open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080 (or the appropriate URL provided by the web server).

Open the browser's developer console, and you should see the greeting message "Hello, WebAssembly!" logged.

This example demonstrates the basic steps to build a Rust WebAssembly application and interact with it from JavaScript. You can customize the code and explore more advanced features provided by wasm-bindgen to interact with JavaScript and the web browser's APIs from Rust.
